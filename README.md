# nuclearSyntaxHighlight
Syntax highlighting for different codes in nuclear engineering. 
So far for Andrea, Helios (Aurora) and Serpent in editors vim and Notepad++.

Serpent for vim has already been done -- see https://github.com/gridley/serpent2vimsyntax.

## Installation

### Notepad++
1. Download files from `notepad++` and save them to `Notepad++\userDefineLangs` directory.
2. It should work. If not, make sure you're using expected file extensions. You can also switch it manually in Languages toolbox.
